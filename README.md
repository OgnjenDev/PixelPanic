## 📌 Description

**PixelPanicVirus** is a fake virus simulator written in Python. It mimics the behavior of a malicious program to scare the user:

- Displays a scary warning message
- Starts a keylogger (`keylog.txt`)
- Plays loud looping music (`music.mp3`)
- Shows a fullscreen "Matrix-style" glitch effect
- Hard to close (requires Task Manager or Alt+F4)

> ⚠️ The program shows a full disclaimer and requires user confirmation before starting.
